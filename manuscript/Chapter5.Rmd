# Introduction

The preceding chapters have served as a background about agricultural markets, and important informational events that drive commodity prices. Going forward, we will focus our energy on the more data and technical questions of actually forecasting elements of the balance sheet - and later, short term price changes using time-series econometric techniques. 

# Forecasting Production 

Our first task in forecasting a balance sheet will be to get a good estimate of production for the marketing year. As we noted before, `Production = Acreage X Yield`. To begin, we will discuss the fundamentals of estimating acreage. 

# Estimating Acreage

Like many other agricultural variables we would like to forecast, our methodology for forecasting acreage depends on the time of year we are making the forecast. Prior to planting season, we can rely on recent trends in acreage from previous years, plus relative profitability of planting competing crops as measured by relative futures prices. 

Historical acres planted and harvested can be found from USDA NASS. 

> ## Steps to download historical acreage data: 
> 1. Go to [http://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/index.asp](http://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/index.asp)
> 2. Click *Crops and Plants* in the menu on the left of the screen
> 3. In the query, choose *Crops* and then *Field Crops*
> 4. Hold down the control key and choose corn
> 5. Click the check boxes for *ACRES PLANTED* and *ACRES HARVESTED* and click the *CONTINUE* button
> 6. You will see a small table; in the bottom right-right hand corner there is a *more...* link. Click it
> 7. Choose *Save::Spreadsheet*, and a Microsoft Excel file will download.

The following is a graph of historical corn *Planted Acres* along with the ratio of *Average Prices Received by Farmers* for corn and soybeans. Average prices received can be downloaded by adjusting step 5 above to download the price data instead.

The following is a graph of historical corn *Planted Acres and Harvested Acres* generated from the data described above from 2000 to 2014. Since 2000, you can see that corn acreage has been increasing steadily from 80 million acres to just above 90 million acres. Given this, prior to planting season we might expect a simple trend-line to forecast corn acreage fairly well. However, notice that in a couple of instances there were fairly large deviations from the trend-line. 

Aside from historical trends, if one considers the decision the average corn farmer makes, he or she considers the relative profitability of planting corn versus planting soybeans. In years where profitability favors corn, more corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing the total number of acres planted to corn. In years where profitability favors soybeans, less corn-on-corn acres will be planted, thus increasing soybean acres and reducing the total number of acres planted to soybeans. This pattern is demonstrated in 2008 and 2011 when an increase in the corn-to-soybean price ratio corresponded to an increase in planted acres. 

Based on the information in Figure 2, one might predict a decline in corn planted acres in the spring of 2015. Although, at the time of planting, the November soybean and December corn futures prices will be the appropriate prices to use for this analysis, because they represent expected profit. 

For example, the following graph shows the December 2016 and November 2016 corn and soybean futures prices respectively for 8/1/2015 to 9/10/2015. The ratio is not graphed here, but since the price of corn is rising relative to the price of soybeans, the relative profitability has drifted toward corn over this time frame. Forecasts of corn and soybean acreage for Spring 2016 should take this into account.

## Forecasting Harvested Acres

After forecasting *Planted Acres* one still needs to provide a forecast for *Harvested Acres*. Figure 4 shows historical trends in *Harvested Acres* relative to *Planted Acres*. The difference between these two variables is provided in grey with units along the right axis for convenience. 

![Figure 4: Corn Planted Acres and Harvested Acres](images\ACREAGE.png)

Harvested acres tends to be a fairly stable number, averaging 7.6 million acres between 2000 and 2014. Although, years when this variable deviates most from trend corresponds to years of exceptionally poor production. See 2012 and 2002 as examples. These years marginal reductions in production are explained by reduced yield and abandoned acres, so forecasting the harvested acres number accurately becomes very important to accurately forecasting production in shortfall years.
