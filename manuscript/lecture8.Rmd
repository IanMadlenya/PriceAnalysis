# Introduction 

In the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Food, Seed and Industrial, and Feed and Residual - while exports make up the third category. Ethanol makes up a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is given its own line in the balance sheet. 

As we have noted before, historical use patterns are the first place to start when trying to forecast use categories for the marketing year. Looking at quarterly gives you a sense of how use is distributed across the marketing year in different categories. The annual histories, however, are probably the most useful. 

# Examining Historical Use Trends

# Corn Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use

Let us begin by looking at the Food, Alcohol and Industrial category. These data were queried from the [Feed Grains database](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780) maintained by the USDA ERS. The categories here are a little more dissaggreagated than those presented in the USDA WASDE balance sheets, but they are roughly the same. For example, in figure 1 below we show the *Food, Alcohol, and Industrial* use category. This omits seed from the *Food, Seed, and Industrial* category in the WASDE balance sheet. The Feed Grains database actually breaks out the seed use as its own column, but corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it is largely predictable from year to year.

Figure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial use category. This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of ethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010 when U.S. ethanol consumption roughly hit the 'blend-wall' where ethanol makes up 10% of the retail gasoline supply.

Figure 2 shows the same data, but the quarterly figures are aggregated to the marketing year total. In both figures 1 and 2 the rationing effects of high prices that occured as a result of the drought in 2012.

From figure 3 it is easier to see what share of the crop the large increase in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. In figure 3 this use category is presented as a percentage of that marketing year's production. In the early 1990's this use category accounted for over 50% since 2010. The drop in percentage of production in 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015, even though the use level is flat (shown in figure 2).

# Corn Exports 

Quarterly corn exports are displayed in figure 4. Unlide Food, alcohol and industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical pattern. Exports are large in the second quarter of the markeing year, December to February, right after we harvest the new crop. This is when stocks are most plentiful and prices are at season lows in years exhibiting an upward sloped forward curve.

# Corn Exports

Displaying the same data in Figure 5, but aggreateing to an annual frequency, we see the marketing seasonality smoothed away.

On average, it appears that exports follow a contstant trendline with variation around the mean produced by years of surplus or scarcity. The drought year 2012, for example is clearly visible as an exceedingly low export year. 

# Corn Exports

In figure 6 we display annual corn exports as a percentage of corn production. 

![Figure 6: Corn Exports, Annual 1990-2015 as a percentage of corn production](FeedGrains_Corn_files\image024.png)

Source: [Feed Grains database](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780) maintained by the USDA ERS.

When exports are viewed as a proportion of production, we see a pronounced downward trend. This is due to the increasing share of production allocated to the Food, seed, and Industrial category visible in figure 3. Recall that this category is comprised mainly of corn as feedstock for ethanol produciton.

The year-to-year variation is caused by price fluctuations with low prices encouraging and high prices discouraging consumption. 

# Feed, and Residual

The final use category is the most difficult to forecast because its quantity is derived, not estimated. What I mean is the USDA makes estimates of every other row in the balance sheet. Then, to ensure the numbers add up, they infer the Feed and Residual category. 

 $Feed\&Residual = Production + Imports + Beginning Stocks + Ending Stocks \\
 - FoodSeed\&Industrial - Exports$

# Feed, and Residual

Since each category on the right hand side is itself estimated with some error, the error for the Feed and Residual category is the sum of the errors of the other categories. 

$\begin{align}
Feed\&Residual = (Production + \epsilon_{prod}) + (Imports + \epsilon_{import}) + (Beginning Stocks + \epsilon_{BStocks}) \\
+ (Ending Stocks + \epsilon_{EStocks}) - (FoodSeed\&Industrial + \epsilon_{Food}) - (Exports + \epsilon_{Export})
\end{align}$

# Feed, and Residual

Figure 7 below displays the Feed and Residual category since 1990.

Unlike Exports which saw its biggest quarter of use in the second quarter of the marketing year (beginning in December), the biggest quarter of use in the Feed and Residual category is the first (beginning in September). This is because at the end of summer ranchers 'brign cattle home from grass' and they begin eating grain and hay instead of green grass on pasture. This is also when calves born in the spring begin to be 'fattened' for slaughter. 

# Feed, and Residual

Figure 8: shows the Feed and Residual category annually and figure 9 shows the category annually as a percent of production.

Figure 8 shows that the category has remained roughly constant over the time-period graphed, but as a percentage of production it has fallen since 2005. Like the export category, this reflects a proportional shift in use toward ethanol production. 

# Ranking Use Categories by Price Sensitivity

Examining annual figures as a percentage of production reveals some interesting facts about the price sensitivity of the three use categories. 

1. The least price sensitive category seems to be Food, Seed, and Industrial. This should be intuitive because this category is composed primarily of corn for feedstock in ethanol production. Since ethanol consumption is effectively mandated at a certain level by the Renewable Fuels Standard, users (gasoline blenders) must purchase a certain amount of ethanol to blend into the retail gasoline supply. This implies a significant portion of the corn crop that will be used regardless of the price. 

2. The second category is Feed and Residual. Although year-to-year variation can come about due to price responsiveness of the U.S. livestock industry, this variation tends to be overwhelmed by the variation due to the aggregate forecast errors in the other categories. 

3. The most price sensitive category is Exports, which is readily visible in figure 5 and 6. Foreign buyers of corn can substitute to purchase their corn from other parts of the world like (Argentina comes first to mind). Also, consumers of meat (exported corn is primariliy used as animal feed in the foreign country) in the less developed world are more price sensitive and presumably reduce consumption when prices are high. 

# Forecasting Use Categories During the Marketing Year - Pace of Use Approach

One method for forecasting the use categories during the marketing year, is to keep track of how much corn has been used to date in each category. This pace of use can be compared to the pace of use in previous years.
