# Introduction 

In the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. Two account for domestic consumption - Food, Seed and Industrial, and Feed and Residual - while exports make up the third category. Ethanol makes up a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is given its own line in the balance sheet. 

As we have noted before, historical use patterns are the first place to start when trying to forecast use categories for the marketing year. Looking at quarterly gives you a sense of how use is distributed across the marketing year in different categories. The annual histories, however, are probably the most useful. 

# Examining Historical Use Trends

# Corn Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use

Let us begin by looking at the Food, Alcohol and Industrial category. These data were queried from the [Feed Grains database](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780) maintained by the USDA ERS. The categories here are a little more dissaggreagated than those presented in the USDA WASDE balance sheets, but they are roughly the same. For example, in figure 1 below we show the *Food, Alcohol, and Industrial* use category. This omits seed from the *Food, Seed, and Industrial* category in the WASDE balance sheet. The Feed Grains database actually breaks out the seed use as its own column, but corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it is largely predictable from year to year.

Figure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial use category. This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of ethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010 when U.S. ethanol consumption roughly hit the 'blend-wall' where ethanol makes up 10% of the retail gasoline supply.

Figure 2 shows the same data, but the quarterly figures are aggregated to the marketing year total. In both figures 1 and 2 the rationing effects of high prices that occured as a result of the drought in 2012.

From figure 3 it is easier to see what share of the crop the large increase in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. In figure 3 this use category is presented as a percentage of that marketing year's production. In the early 1990's this use category accounted for over 50% since 2010. The drop in percentage of production in 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015, even though the use level is flat (shown in figure 2).

# Corn Exports 

Quarterly corn exports are displayed in figure 4. Unlide Food, alcohol and industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical pattern.

Displaying the same data in Figure 5, but aggreateing to an annual frequency, we see the marketing seasonality smoothed away.
